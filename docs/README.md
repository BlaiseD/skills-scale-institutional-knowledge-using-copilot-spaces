# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative delivery approach to project management. Our process prioritizes delivering value in small, testable increments, with clear ownership and data-informed decision-making. Each project is guided by a named Project Manager who coordinates delivery, schedules, risks, and communications, working alongside a Product Lead who defines outcomes and measures success.

Our project lifecycle consists of five core phases: Initiation (problem definition and stakeholder alignment), Planning (scope and backlog development), Execution (build, test, and iterate), Release (deployment and verification), and Retrospective (learning capture and continuous improvement). Throughout each phase, teams maintain consistent communication cadences including weekly PM/Product Lead syncs, twice-weekly standups, and monthly stakeholder updates.

Quality assurance is embedded throughout the process, with automated testing in CI pipelines, code review requirements, and acceptance criteria validation. We maintain psychological safety by encouraging feedback and learning, running blameless retrospectives, and using risk registers to proactively identify and mitigate issues. Our workflows emphasize small pull requests, clear documentation, and transparent progress tracking via project boards.

The documentation in this folder provides detailed guidance on each lifecycle phase, role definitions, communication strategies, and quality practices. These docs are designed to help new team members quickly understand our approach and provide reference material for experienced practitioners.

## Key Artifacts

- **One-pager**: A concise project charter defining the problem statement, objectives, success metrics, stakeholders, timeline, and team roles
- **Backlog**: Prioritized list of work items with acceptance criteria, estimates, and owners that guide sprint planning and execution
- **Risk Register**: Living document tracking identified risks with impact, likelihood, mitigation plans, and status updates
- **Release Plan**: Timeline showing milestones, dependencies, and deployment windows aligned with product roadmap
- **Retrospectives**: Post-sprint or post-release reviews capturing what went well, improvement areas, and actionable next steps
