# OctoAcme â€” Design Handoff Checklist

## Purpose
Ensure smooth handoffs between UX Designers and Developers to maintain design quality and reduce implementation rework.

## When to Use
Use this checklist when transitioning designs from UX Designer to development team for implementation.

## Pre-Handoff (UX Designer)
- [ ] User research findings documented and shared
- [ ] Wireframes or mockups finalized and approved by Product Manager
- [ ] Interactive prototype created (if needed for complex flows)
- [ ] Design specifications documented (spacing, colors, typography, states)
- [ ] Accessibility requirements noted (WCAG compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- [ ] Edge cases and error states designed
- [ ] Design assets exported and shared (icons, images, etc.)
- [ ] Design review completed with stakeholders

## Handoff Meeting (UX Designer + Developers)
- [ ] Walkthrough of user flows and interaction patterns
- [ ] Review of design specifications and component usage
- [ ] Discussion of technical constraints or implementation questions
- [ ] Clarification of responsive behavior and breakpoints
- [ ] Agreement on animation and transition timing
- [ ] Identification of reusable components or design system elements

## During Development (Developer + UX Designer Collaboration)
- [ ] Developers flag implementation questions or constraints early
- [ ] UX Designer available for design clarifications
- [ ] Regular design review checkpoints scheduled
- [ ] Design QA performed before final PR approval

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implementation matches approved designs
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Responsive behavior verified across breakpoints
- [ ] Interactive states (hover, focus, active, disabled) implemented
- [ ] UX Designer sign-off on implementation

## Resources
- Design system / component library (if applicable)
- Brand guidelines
- Accessibility standards reference
