# OctoAcme â€” Project Initiation Guide

## Purpose
Define the initial steps to validate and authorize work, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan.

## When to use
Whenever a new project idea or feature proposal is ready to be explored.

## Goals
- Confirm business need and measurable outcome
- Identify stakeholders & champions
- Define success criteria and initial timeline
- Decide go/no-go for planning

## Minimum Deliverables
- Project One-pager (Problem, Goal, Success Metrics)
- Stakeholder list & communication plan
- High-level timeline and key milestones
- Initial risk list
- Resource needs (team roles, rough effort estimate)
- Cross-functional team composition identified

## Team Composition Considerations
Consider which roles are needed based on project scope:
- **Core roles** (typically always needed): Project Manager, Product Manager, Developers
- **Design-focused projects**: UX Designer for user research and interface design
- **API or complex features**: Technical Writer for documentation
- **Multi-team or complex releases**: Release Manager for coordination
- **Customer-impacting changes**: Customer Support Lead for readiness and communication

See [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for detailed role definitions.
