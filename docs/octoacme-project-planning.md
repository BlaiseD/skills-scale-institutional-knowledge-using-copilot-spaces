# OctoAcme â€” Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:
- Estimate:
- Owner:
- Related docs/links:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Cross-Functional Collaboration
Ensure all relevant roles are engaged during planning:
- **UX Designer**: Validates user flows and design requirements are captured
- **Technical Writer**: Identifies documentation needs and timeline for content creation
- **Release Manager**: Confirms release windows and deployment dependencies
- **Customer Support Lead**: Reviews feature scope for support training and communication needs
- **Developers**: Provide technical input on implementation approach and estimates

See [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for detailed interaction patterns between roles.

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
- Identify handoff points between roles (e.g., design to development, development to documentation)
