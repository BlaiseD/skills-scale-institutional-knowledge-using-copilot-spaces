# OctoAcme â€” Release & Deployment Guide

## Purpose
Standardize how OctoAcme releases features to production to reduce risk and improve observability.

## Release Types
- Patch: hotfixes addressing critical production issues
- Minor: incremental features and improvements
- Major: significant functionality or breaking changes

## Release Coordination
The **Release Manager** coordinates the release process and facilitates the release readiness review. Key responsibilities include:
- Schedule and communicate deployment windows
- Verify all pre-release requirements are met
- Facilitate go/no-go decision meeting

- Ensure all stakeholders are informed of release status
