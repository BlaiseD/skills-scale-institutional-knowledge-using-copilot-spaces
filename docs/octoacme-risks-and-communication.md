# OctoAcme â€” Risk Management & Communication

## Purpose
Explain how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies.

## Risk Register
Maintain a simple table with:
- ID
- Description
- Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner
- Mitigation plan
- Status

## Risk Lifecycle
- Identify: during planning and ongoing execution
- Assess: estimate impact and likelihood
- Mitigate: reduced via actions, contingency plans
- Monitor: review at weekly syncs and update status

## Stakeholder Communication
- Identify stakeholder groups and communication needs (e.g., engineering, sales, support)
- Provide regular updates (weekly or milestone-based)
- Use a single source of truth (project README or release doc) for status

## Role-Specific Communication Channels
Different roles have specific communication needs and touchpoints:
- **Release Manager**: Coordinates release announcements, deployment windows, and go/no-go decisions
- **Technical Writer**: Publishes documentation updates and release notes
- **Customer Support Lead**: Communicates customer-impacting changes to support team and escalates critical issues
- **UX Designer**: Shares research findings and design reviews with product and engineering teams
